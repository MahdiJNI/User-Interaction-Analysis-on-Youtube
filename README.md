The Whole Data Is Collected manually.
At first I tried to collect the data through scraping but it was really unstable and did not work efficiently. then i tried " Googleapiclieant " library which as you may know, it has a few limits &
you can not get the whole data that you want, all at once, if you're going to have a large dataset or many requests. there are a few websites that offer these sort of services but I did not 
find them affordable at the time, there I had to collect the whole data manually.
